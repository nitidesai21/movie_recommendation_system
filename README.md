Smart Movie Recommender
Introduction
Smart Movie Recommender is an AI-driven web application that helps users discover new movies tailored to their personal tastes. It does this by intelligently analyzing previous movie ratings for each user and generating personalized film suggestions with just a simple User ID input.

Project Objectives
Create an easy-to-use recommendation website for movie lovers.

Use real user ratings and smart algorithms for recommendations.

Combine machine learning, web development, and databases for a seamless, end-to-end system.

Features

•Recommends movies based on each user’s unique rating history.

•Attractive and intuitive web interface for a pleasant user experience.

•Keeps a database of previous recommendations for returning users.

•Trained and evaluated machine learning models for high-quality sug•gestions.

•Handles new users, missing data, and allows for easy scaling.

Workflow

1.Data Preparation and Exploration
The project begins with analyzing datasets containing user ratings, movie information, and tags.

Data cleaning is performed to handle missing values or user tags, and to merge all relevant data for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) visualizes the most popular movies and genres, and investigates general rating behavior.

2.Model Building and Evaluation
A user-item ratings matrix is constructed to capture interactions between users and movies.

The core recommendation engine uses the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) approach from the Surprise library, widely used for collaborative filtering.

The model is trained and tested, with evaluation metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to verify performance.

3.Web Application Development
Flask, a Python web framework, powers the backend. Users interact with a simple web interface, entering their User ID to receive curated movie recommendations.

SQLAlchemy manages the SQLite database, storing users and recommendations for quick access and future personalization.

The frontend is designed with a stylish, modern template for readability and ease of use.

4.Recommendation Generation
Each time a user enters an ID, the trained SVD model predicts highly-rated, yet unseen movies for that specific user.

Recommendations are presented in an engaging and clear manner, ready for exploration.

Key Technologies Used
•Python: For all data, backend, and model logic.

•Pandas, NumPy: Data wrangling and analysis.

•Surprise: SVD-based recommendation engine.

•Flask & SQLAlchemy: Web server and database handling.

•HTML/CSS: For an appealing, interactive frontend.

My Work and Contributions

•Built and tuned data preparation pipelines and performed the exploratory analysis.

•Developed, trained, and evaluated the collaborative filtering machine learning model.

•Designed and implemented the full Flask web application, including backend logic and database integration.

•Created a user-friendly and responsive frontend layout.

•Managed the deployment and ensured smooth session flow between user and recommendation output.

Usage Instructions

•Open the Smart Movie Recommender web application.

•Enter a valid User ID where prompted.

•Instantly receive and explore a personalized list of recommended movies.

•No coding or installations are required for end-users, making it accessible to everyone.

Future Enhancements

•Adding support for user sign-up and profile management.

•Incorporating content-based or hybrid recommendation mod•els.

•Enabling real-time feedback and re-training for even more accurate suggestions.
